        <h3>Team building and personal development</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">All our courses encourage personal development, with a specific focus on the dynamics of successful teamwork. Our courses are tailored to meet the requirements of the students and the philosophy of the school.  The health and safety of pupils participating in educational trips and visits is of paramount importance. We pride ourselves on our safety management, which is constantly revised. Our instructors are all qualified and hold current National Qualifications in each of the relevant fields they teach, together with a current First Aid Certificate and are CRB checked. In house training is undertaken by all instructors and assistants. On regular site inspections by senior instructors ensure that our safety standards are maintained. Equipment used at the centre meets with BSI or UIAA standards and is inspected before and after each activity. Periodic maintenance is carried out on all equipment with records kept at the office.
            <br>Your school's needs will be discussed before a definite program can be designed.</p>
