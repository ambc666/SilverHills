        <h2>Stag and Hen</h2>
            <h3>Stag and Hen Activity Weekends in Scotland</h3>
            <p class="text">At Silver Hills we offer a great range of activities, from adrenalin days to more relaxed canoe trips down the river Wye.  So if you are looking to organise a weekend for the Bride or Groom to remember then we have it all.  "Jumping off cliffs" on the gorge walk, "being washed down water slides" in the cave, "abseiling" down a rock walls or "riding the waves" on our white water rafting trips, "being pushed outside your comforts zone" on the high level ropes course.	If you want to get away from it all, then our open canoeing days are ideal. If you come for the weekend or just for the day you will have lots of memories to take back with you, we promise!  The Stag and Hen weekends are legendary, we have been in the business long enough to understand the needs of both stags and hens. All our weekends are full of stag and hens having a great time. We have accommodation to suit all budgets. The providers are on the same wavelength as us, offering hearty breakfasts, great meals, real ale and fine wines.</p>
